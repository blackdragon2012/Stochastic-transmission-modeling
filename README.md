# Stochastic-transmission-modeling

This report presents a stochastic SEIR epidemic model for a community with secondary groupings, such as schools with distinct classes. Utilizing data from the 1861 measles outbreak in Hagelloch, Germany, we employ a maximum log-likelihood estimation algorithm to determine the optimal infection-avoiding probability. While two mixing levels yield satisfactory results, they lack consistency. Future research may explore models with three levels of mixing for improved accuracy, aligning with suggestions from previous studies. Our analysis focuses on a detailed dataset of a measles outbreak among 188 children in Hagelloch. Validation involves 1000 simulations, comparing model outcomes to observed data, and experimenting with different latent and rash period parameters.

**Key Points:**

▪ Under Prof. Frank Ball’s supervision, studied the outbreak of measles in the German village of Hagelloch in 1861, to find a stochastic
transmission model for the spread of the disease among children.

▪ Utilised R Studio to clean, prepare and transform data for modelling.

▪ Performed an exploratory data analysis using ggplot2 package.

▪ Performed maximum likelihood estimation to find the infection avoidance probability.

▪ Conducted a comparative analysis of actual data with over 1000 simulations of the estimated data to validate the model’s performance.

▪ Presented the research findings through a comprehensive IEEE report, encompassing literature reviews, defined objectives and diverse
analytic components.
